<h2>1 Crocus </h2> 

Noon before dark, in a world that is like earth called earthoran. The wind whistles
sharply, but anyone who could ever feel this would feel warm and cold outside.<<br>
Pak!<br>
Pak!<br>
A man with a scar on his face with four more male companions and three girls was
watching the Scarface's man beating up a teenager, badly.
"You!? H-"<br>
Said the teenager while a fist was smashed on his face.
"Aren't you a little full of yourself? Saving a damsel in distress...<br> What a load of crap. I
don't know who you are, but you are basically in our trap."<br>
Maniacally said, by the Scarface man. He was enjoying the mental torture of the
teenager who had a despairing look on his face.
'What is going on? I thought she was in danger. I thought she was...<br>'
The teen remembers what happened to both of them. The story started when he left
the Family because of the pressure he felt when he was the only one who didn't
awaken his spirit. Spirit is a sign of nobility and without this. He would become a
commoner, so he embarked on a journey to find his spirit.
'Is that true? Maya?'<br>
The teen looked at the girl he had feelings for. When all hope is gone and couldn't find
a spirit and give up to become a nobility once again. He met a girl named Maya who
was smart and soft-spoken, her smile brightens his day for a long time. He thought
they had a mutual understanding, but now… he didn't understand what happened.
'Boring...<br>'<br>
Now, Maya with her silky black hair and black eyes, wearing glasses while smoking
comfortably. Suddenly sensed the teen is looking at her dazed. She recognized that
kind of expression, the look of complete loss and absence of hope in his eyes.
.1,<br>
,
'What a hopeless loser. Is this truly a prince...<br> I hate his look, his small d*ck...<br> His voice
and his cry. I f*cking hate it all! Hmm...<br> Maybe I'll punish him more...<br> I like to see him
fall even further.'<br>
Maya stood up from where she was and gave sweet eye contact to the Scarface. The
Scarface greedily showed his teeth with a confident smile.
"Finally."<br><br>
He said as he walked and sat in front of the despairing Teenager. Maya also walked
toward them and winked at the teenager and then made another eye contact with the
Scarface.<br>
"Here it comes."<br><br>
Scarface took out his massive rod and the girl, Maya, sat on it while looking at the
teenager with amusement on her face.<br>
"I remember the time you said you love me...<br> Ah...<br> We only had a week of romance...<br>
It's fun playing with you, Prince...<br> Should I say former prince Crocus Phereon?"
The terror unfolds the expression of Crocus, his mind which is fuzzy and messy finally
crumbles.<br>
"H- H- How did you know?"<br>
Satisfied, Maya shakes her hips to make the rod of the Scarface even harder.
"For the money, but you are a former prince already...<br> You are now useless unlike
when you were a prince. You don't even have a single penny...<br> So pathetic...<br> You are
also boring, not even the slightest experience for girls...<br> What a load of a loser you
are...<br> You know what...<br> It's fun seeing you like this. It's also turning me on."<br>
The Scarface with a victory and demonic smile. He touched his hips of Maya.
"Can I put it in?"<br>
He said as the expression on Maya's face changed. This time it's pure craziness and
lust...<br> She liked the expression of Crocus is making, she might want to put it it. When
Crocus saw this, he couldn't help but open his mouth.
"YOU TWOOOOoo...<br> Why are you doing this to me!?!"
He said with a twisted face.<br>
'Why!? Why!? Why!? I thought we would have a better life with each other...<br> So why!?'
.2,<br>
,
"You are looking even more pathetic."<br> Said Maya while looking down at him.
"Do you really have to do that, Maya?" One of the girls asked and came forward.
Maya's expression changed.<br>
"This is none of your business, Mary. Don't tell me you like this loser?"
The girl named Mary, ha rump!<br>
"This is none of my business."<br><br>
All of a sudden...<br><br>
Without a signal, a hand appeared at the back of Crocus's neck and chopped him. This
made Crocus's vision darken, and in a second, he became unconscious.
A man in a suit came out from his back, he was wearing a serious-looking expression.
Like a man on duty.<br>
"You two are digging your own grave...<br> But it will fill him with rage, so it's okay."<br>
Maya left off the Scarface lap, after cleaning and wearing their clothing properly. They
looked at the man in the suit with a little dread. After all, this is a communist country
and when a royal wants them to be executed, they would be executed.
"Don't worry, the supreme leader elites will make you two of their members and will
be protected. Your identities will also be hidden...<br> If only ever this former prince
awakened his spirit."<br><br>
The two suddenly heave a sigh of relief.<br>
"So he won't be able to take revenge. I thought those family members of elites that
can't awaken Their Spirits would become normal people only."<br><br>
Said the Scarface man. His looks changed into a kind-looking uncle, and so is the lady.
"I will take him now. The money is already sent to your accounts."<br><br>
The man in the suit said to the two and others at the back. Soon he left, carrying
Crocus on his shoulder. The man in the suit stopped and looked in a certain direction
seriously.<br>
"Hm...<br> If it was years ago, I would've done my job with these rejected elite offspring. I
am also sure that woman already had her way to the supreme leader with the changes
that are happening recently."<br><br>
He looked over at the man on his shoulder.<br>

"I'm a sorry little guy, but you will be put in my experiment...<br> I will not take you back
to the palace where you could awaken your Spirit. That girl also wants me to make
you feel helpless...<br> A man who lost everything...<br> However, I also wanted to try
something and most of all, that girl who made me do this didn't have the blood of the
Phereon Family to control me...<br> "<br>
The man in the suit threw Crocus inside a car. After injecting another sleeping serum,
the man in the suit drives to a long way road.
Soon, they reached a park and the man in the suit carried Crocus and put him in front
of a statue with seven demon heads.<br>
"Ah...<br> The seven demon statues that kept my family from hoping that the enslavement
of the first King of this Dust Kingdom would be gone...<br> The Phereon family...<br> It says
that my family ancestor tried to awaken the demons on this statue but all of them
died, all of them failed...<br><br>
"What if I put the blood of those who enslave my family instead? I want to know...<br>
What will happen...<br> What will happen...<br>"<br><br>
About an hour had passed. The man in suit's preparations was about to complete.
"Several lit candles...<br> Complete...<br> a bowl of mixed ingredients atop a Baalomepham
symbol, which is a goat's head inside a pentagram...<br> Complete...<br> An unconscious
body...<br> Everything is complete."<br><br>
He put the unconscious body of Crocus in the seven demon head statue.
*Aad ligand eos pariter eos coram me! Halokab ka bagar, makakanuson arhm goha for
demo dayo!*<br>
The man in the suite changed.
*Aad ligand eos pariter eos coram me! Halokab ka bagar, makakanuson arhm goha for
demo dayo!*<br>
It was a chant or power to summon the soul, spirit, or the demon itself.
Wind flows like a whirlpool, surrounding them while thunder rumbles and night
becomes even darker.<br>
*Woossh* *Woossh* *Woossh*<br>
Seconds...<br><br>
Minutes...<br><br>

Hours...<br><br>
Had passed.<br>
The man in the suit kneeled on the ground. His arms became rotten dark and his eyes
faltered.<br>
"Why? Failed? I've seen three black shadows and one transparent one entered his
body, but why?"<br>
Then he became even darker. Soon, the whole park had a stench of death.<br>

  <h2>2. Me or not Me!?</h2>
 *If I ever had a chance, I would be a King! Whatever it was or whatever it may be! I
don't know if I'll be good or bad but I swear I will do anything if ever had a chance!!*
In the park, near the seven demon statues. Crocus Phereon was lying on the ground,
covered with white ash that smells like burnt flesh.<br>
*I won't be an apathetic boy in love, a failed undergraduate college Information
technology student, a no-career individual and a loser again! Next time I will do
anything to become the person I want to be!*<br>
"Who is this? Why does it feel like it was me?"
Said Crocus, while looking at the sky. His body felt like he was beaten down and every
piece of his bone was destroyed.<br>
*Sacrifice everything! To the new me...<br> If there are other worlds...<br> I hope when you or
you ever hear this...<br> I hope you honor my words! I, Ashtaroth Crocus will be a King
someday! No matter what happens!*<br>

"Another me!? My past life memories? Planet earth!?"<br>
Crocus's head became even more painful from that.<br>
*I am too poor to even date a girl, and I am ashamed of this life. I wish I were a King
or an Aristocrat from a filthy rich family so that girls would line up to me, and people
would look up to me...<br> King Crocus...<br> Duke Crocus...<br> Tycoon Crocus...<br> I wonder how it
feels to be like that. When I don't have to work for my life, nor will I care about my
career. Finding wives would be easy peasy...<br> But I know it's impossible.*<br>
"AARRGHHHHH!!!"<br>
Crocus released an agonizing scream as his memories of his past life or another life
came inside his head.<br>
*The application that I created on my phone and the other games that accompanied
me, trash me. I am so sorry that I can't take it anymore. I don't have anyone anyway.
I'm just a product of two divorced parents. Goodbye, my phone that always takes
away my loneliness...<br> I hope I can take you with me.*<br>
This made veins on Crocus's forehead bulge.<br>
"PAAAAIIINNFFFUULLLLL!!!! PAAAAIIINNFFFUULLLLL!!!! PAAAAIIINNFFFUULLLLL!!!!"
After a few hours of never-ending screaming. Crocus finally stopped. The body that
feels so warm and the sky that is looking red.<br>
"I am...<br>"<br><br>
Crocus saw his hand. He still didn't know what was happening and why his
surroundings were red.<br>
"Huh!?"<br>
He was wide-eyed when he saw where he was right now. His breathing also felt like
he was a little not used to it.<br>
'What is this?'<br>
Crocus could see the trees are without leaves and all of them are black. Cracks all
over the cement ground and it smells like charcoal.<br>
"What's going on!? What is this!?"<br>
Crocus suddenly noticed what he was wearing.<br>
'Huh!? What the!? No wonder it is heavy. Is somebody pranking me!?'<br>

His new outfit is a b heavy long sleeve polo shirt. It was heavy, and he felt like the
fabric was not washed because it was itchy. A stylized yoke on the front and the back.
It is constructed of chambray, denim, or tartan fabric with long sleeves, and in
modern form is sometimes seen with snap pockets, patches made from bandana
fabric, and fringe.<br>
Arrrgghh!!<br>
Crocus groaned. His head felt heavy and when he tried to put his hand on it, he felt a
little wet and sticky. Looking at it, he felt a great apprehension of fear.
"Blood!? What's going on!?"<br>
All of the sudden...<br><br>
Zennnnnnnnnnnnnggg!<br>
Zennnnnnnnnnnggg!<br>
Zennnnnnnnggg!<br>
It was a pain in his head. He didn't understand like he was looking at this unfamiliar
place that is swirling into the void.<br>
Out of nowhere in front of him, a screen appeared with text written inside.
"Sh*t, I remember Maya and what they did. Fortunately, I am not feeling anything
about it...<br> Maybe because I remembered my past life. I don't know this place...<br> I can
remember my last life on earth or is it me? am I back to earth or I was just thrown
here in this unfamiliar place? I don't think this is still earth or what is that? a memory?
of my alternate universe self in a so-called earth?"<br>
All of a sudden, Crocus looked at his side as he can smell something like there was
burning.<br>
He saw the body of someone he knew.<br>
"Batros?"<br>
The head of Batros was missing a left eye, and half of his stomach, but the two feet
were still intact. It's like he was being burnt as the skin of the missing part was
decaying while burning.<br>
"What's going on!? He is here that means...<br> Ah...<br> This is still Planet Earthoran...<br> I am
not back on earth and those memories are my memories of the earth...<br> My dream...<br> I<br>

will never forget who I am...<br> New life...<br> New me...<br> I will honor my word and promise to
be a...<br> King!!!"<br>
All of a sudden, a screen appeared in front of Crocus.<br>
[I am 'ALL SYSTEM' and I'm here to guide all creatures with intelligence like all
humans in this game. Yes, a newly born child or on a death door old people do not
have an unfortunate and fortunate chance in this game!]<br>
It was sudden and made Crocus freeze. From his place, to anywhere on this planet
Earthoran, the message has been heard.<br>
[This is a game of survival! A survival of the fittest! Strong eats the weak! Survival of
the fittest! The winner takes all! To know more about me, just say inside your head the
word...<br> 'ALL SYSTEM MENU!'<br>
[It will appear like this...<br><br>
[ALL SYSTEM:<br>
[Level: 0<br>
[Instructions/ Announcements<br>
[Gifts (0)<br>
[Buy (<) Sell (>)<br>
[Name of the user status.]<br>
"What is this bullsh*t? Are you kidding me!?"<br>
Crocus said, he just got his past or earth memory and now fate is telling him that this
Earthoran that he loves is going to become a massive game crap?<br>
"In the memories, I recovered. I said I love games...<br> but not this massive crap that will
put my life in danger...<br>"<br><br>
[All your lives will turn into a game. Big countries aren't going to war with each
other...<br> not also to reduce population...<br> but for this moment only...<br> those who are
immune will live from zombification and get to have spirits in this game of survival to
protect themselves or a lucky chance...<br> and those who are not immune will become
undead.<br>
[The game will start when one sees the sun become redder and redder agitating your
eyes. As the virus is already enveloping the whole planet Earthoran, the universe will
<br>
turn into chaos...<br> Animals and insects will mutate and even places will become
dangerous. I hope that some of you survive. Krakrakrakra! ]<br>
"My eyes!!?"<br>
Crocus came to a stop when he read and heard this part.
"Eh!?"<br>
[If you're unlucky for some unfortunate event that you didn't get an immunized
serum. You still tame spirits to be immune to viruses. How to tame it? You will read it
in the instructions/announcement.<br>
[For now, As a gift for my first contact with the humanity of this earthoran, all of you
win two wishes where two-person can wish two wishes of anything they dezziiree by
answering either of the two questions.]<br>
Crocus, however, is not listening and looking at the system screen when he read the
part about the virus.<br>
"My vision is slightly red. Could it be!?<br>
"This is not a joke!"<br>
Crocus felt an impending doom. An oppressive and overwhelming feeling; sucking the
joy out of his life.<br>
"I'm one of the unfortunate ones!? No No No!"<br>
Looking at the slightly red moon sun, Crocus had his breath taken away from him.
"No...<br> I'm infected by their virus no...<br> Why am I not immune? A prince not even giving
an immunity serum? Do they plan to kill me!?"<br>
His eyes were ragged as he stared at the 'All system' screen.<br>
[The first question: Who are the three scariest and most dangerous angels of all?]
Crocus was a little surprised by the question.<br>
"Angel? What? I thought they were friendly? Wait… my reading comprehension hehe
Scary right? Who are those angels? I have no idea."<br><br>
[ Congratulations: the answers were Seraph, Cherubs, and Ophanims. The winner is
from the West communist United states of Taured.<br>
[ The winner wished for a power to pause anything he touches which is a little
terrifying and a power to become immune to the virus to avoid being bitten and
.<br>
affected by any kind of virus. I'm sorry for those who lost, maybe next time...<br> See you
again, soon. ]<br>
Crocus felt his feet had a strong, strenuous effort to stand up. His back felt heavy and
his mind was turning hazy. Suddenly, his eyes widened.<br>
"What's going on!? Am I going to turn into a zombie? Why is it so fast!? Is this the end
of me? What about my dreams? What about everything that I wished to do? I want a
chance! Someone, please give me a chance."<br><br>
All is useless, and he knew that there's such a thing as a miracle, just like now, but he
is sure that it's going to happen just as he wished to. He felt like he couldn't control
himself anymore, as his mind felt numb.<br>
He didn't know that the 'All system' screen was giving him a warning.
[Detected: Unknown, mysterious phenomenon...<br> An unknown mysterious
phenomenon...<br> An unknown mysterious phenomenon...<br>]<br>
...<br>
In a space full of stars...<br> A giant eye opened.
"Hrmm"<br>
It made a low, angry grunt for a second.
"Jwndhauxbs! Ywuksuyehs."<br><br>
The giant closed its eyes again and disappeared into the starry sky.<br>

  <h2>
3 Game Dimension System
"Huh!?"</h2>

Crocus was greeted by the unknown, all-white dimension.<br>
"I thought I was going to die and turn into a flesh-eating zombie, but what is this?"
Suddenly, he looked left and right for something...<br><br>
About a second later...<br><br>
「 Welcome...<br> Copied real-life body...<br> Copied real-life body… Copied real-life body...<br> 」
Crocus saw another system screen in front of him.<br>
"What is that? Welcome? Copying a real-life body? Why did it change its color?"
He thought the system screen differs from the 'All system' in the Earthoran.
「 Creation of avatar complete...<br> Discovered a foreign entity in the host's real body...<br><br>
Identifying...<br> Identifying...<br> 」<br>
"What is going on!?"<br>
Crocus felt mentally drained by all the things that are happening and now this!?
「 Identified 'All system' the system that is copied by the host. Creating us...<br> Game
Dimension system with more advantages...<br><br>
「 Prince: Crocus Phereon<br>
「 Level: 0<br>
「 Health Points: 100/100<br>
「 Status: Tired<br>
「 Hearts: 3<br>
「 Spirit: None<br>
「 Magic Power: None<br>
「 Territory: Dust Territory<br>
「 「 > 」<br>
「 Please click [>] for more information about the user.
「 Say, 'Game system status' to make the status appear again. 」
Crocus felt his hair stand up.<br>
'Wait, wait, does it mean that this system is created by me!?'
.11,<br>
,
"What do you mean you are created by me!?"<br>
「 Answering the host, you are a failed information technology student because you
created a system that can make maps, a game placed on the phone. Meeting with so-
called Saint Elmo's fire or Dimensionally unstable gap then you fused it with your
game, you created us...<br> Gaming Dimensions System<br>
」<br>
Hearing and seeing the answer on the screen of the Game Dimension system, Crocus
was in disbelief.<br>
"Fuse!? Who did!? And how did it go!?"<br>
「 Someone we don't know. He had this hatred of putting you swapping your body for
this reality by sacrificing his life. The journey to this new life of yours and being
reborn into this world made it fuse the phone game, the dimension, and your soul.
」<br>
"Is that even possible!?"
「 It is. 」<br>
Crocus put his fingers on his chin, stroking it.
'In my last life, I was a failed information technology student, but I failed in passing
because I created something impossible...<br> Should be impossible, that's why I didn't
finish it.<br>
'My inspiration is pocket monster go, however, the difference I made is like an RPG
game where I could find treasures, face quests, and monsters like dungeons that
depend on the place where I go.<br>
'For example, If I go to the cemetery. J should be able to make it a place full of quests,
monsters, and treasures inside my phone. Should be impossible because it's
impossible to create random quests and game settings in every location and that's
why I failed the thesis. Without a scholarship, I drop out of school.'
After Crocus internally tried to convince himself, he found a loophole that this Game
Dimensions system could lie and only wanted to control him as a system of slave-like
others.<br>
"Last time I was here. I didn't see you, so how are you here?"
He asked with a serious expression on his face.
'You can't fool me! I won't be a system of slaves for you. I would rather kill myself than
be a slave.'<br>

「 Answering the user. Last time we didn't have consciousness, and you died entering
inside, but after the user contacted the 'ALL SYSTEM' outside. It tried to enter the
Game Dimension that the user created. Because of that, all its external connections
disappeared and then were born once again into this game dimension.
」<br>
"Then you are the newly born system? extracted from the All system? A copy?"
「 Yes. 」<br>
Crocus felt a sense of joy.
'This is my dimension? I just don't know about the game because I never experienced
it.'<br>
His confidence rose as he asked...<br><br>
"Does it mean that I have two systems? Can I use you the outside of my consciousness
too? Plus, don't call me 'User'. You may address me whatever you like but not user."<br><br>
「 Your highness, my majesty, King Crocus. Unfortunately, it can only be used during
sleep or meditation. Any foreign entity that tries to disturb you will forcefully log you
out in this game dimension. The 'All system' is controlled and owned by a foreign
entity and his job is to talk to all the humans.<br>
」<br>
"Really?"<br>
「 Yes, your highness, my majesty, King Crocus. 」<br>
"Just call me, Your Highness."<br><br>
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br>
Crocus looked at the screen silently.<br>
"I wonder what the game is, and can you help me play the game?"<br>
「 To play the game, you need to leave the safe area, your highness. Unfortunately, I
would be useless once you leave the safe area. I can only give warning notifications
once you play and please be careful of your hearts. If you lose all of them, you will die
for real.<br>
」<br>
Reading and hearing this, Crocus was stunned and rooted in his place.
"Eh!? I can die in the game?"<br>
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br>
Crocus was brooding over it.<br>
.
'I thought I won't die in my dimension. It seems I'm wrong...<br> Doesn't matter, as long as
I am not controlled and forced to do things against my will.'<br>
"How do I play the game? Also, what is the game?"<br>
He asked curiously. He knew it was random, but he wished since he was here already,
his system would know.<br>
「 Regarding the game, your highness. It's all random. 」<br>
Crocus found it ridiculous.<br>
"Random? What about the level? What if it's a higher level and I could die anytime
instantly?"<br>
「 The game would always start at the user's level, but sometimes it will ignore all the
levels and the user would be a mortal. 」<br>
Crocus nodded with understanding.<br>
"That's more like it. That's how a game works...<br> Should I play now?"<br>
「 Your highness, you can start anytime. Just say, 'Game On!' 」<br>
Crocus took a deep breath.<br>
'I don't know what kind of game I will experience, but I have three more lives in this
dimension.'<br>
"GAME ON!"<br>
「 Game on activated! Establishing connection to realms...<br> Connecting...<br> Connecting...<br>
Human-made...<br> Gigantic Monsters...<br> Elemental Creatures...<br> Connecting...<br>
Connecting...<br> User's level of zero...<br> Searching dimensions...<br> Searching dimensions...<br>
」<br>
Crocus could only wryly smile. About three seconds had passed...<br>
「 Status: Connected! Forest of dawn! The user is level zero...<br> Finding places for level
zero...<br> for the user who didn't have spirit...<br> finding...<br> finding...<br> finding...<br> Found! The
game was created!<br>
」
"Huh?"<br>
Crocus made a little grunt.
'So, it will create a game dimension on its own and it would be random and would
look for a suitable place depending on my level.'
.<br>
「 Please remain in your position. The portal will be opened! 」
Crocus felt a circle of light enveloping him warmly. He closed his eyes unconsciously
and when he opened them...<br><br>
"Woah...<br> What are these roads?"
「 User entered the paths! Warning! The path you choose will determine your future!
No turning back! 」<br>
Crocus saw four roads in unknown directions. He moved slowly without wasting time
to one of them and when he was about to enter the one at the center.<br>
「 Elemental Ghost Spirit path! The elemental spirit path is the rarest of the three
spirit paths. Those who have taken this path and gained their nightmare creature's
recognition might be granted the power to transform their body's composition into a
natural element of ghosts at will, as well as create and control it.<br>
「 Proceed to the elemental ghost spirit path? The user has a 20/100 chance of living.
」<br>
Crocus's eyes widened with delight. His eyes are not focused on the 20/100 chance,
but only on the 'chance to get the spirit.'<br>
"I can have spirit!? What!? I won't turn into a zombie once I get one? Well...<br> Well...<br>
Well...<br> transforming into an undead won't be a problem anymore.<br>
"Hmmm...<br> Elemental Ghost, huh? The 'ALL SYSTEM' in the Earthoran said nothing
after leaving about spirits because I only know that spirits are used for status...<br> now...<br>
However...<br> it seems there's more to it...<br><br>
"If I enter, I would die, right!? ...<br> I hope there are hard and easy modes...<br> But well, I'm
not in a position to complain...<br> I have to be careful...<br>"<br><br>
However, Crocus did not get in. He trusted his guts and tries to stand up on the other
path.<br>
「 Modern weapon path! It is steel and normal. Those who have taken this path and
gained their weapon creature recognition might be granted the power to make
themselves human weapons. Like a human bomb, human gun, human sword, human
knife, etc.<br>
「 Proceed to the modern weapon path? The user has a 20/100 chance of living. 」
Crocus was looking at it like an expert trying to analyze all of it.
.<br>
"It has the same danger. What about the other one?"<br>
「 Prehistoric monster path! It is a draconic path. Those who have taken this path and
gained their prehistoric creatures' recognition might be granted the power to make
themselves Half or full dinosaur beasts with a high amount of physical endurance and
strength. Like a human raptor, human tyrannosaurus, human spinosaurus, human
pterodactyl, etc.<br>
「 Proceed to the prehistoric monster path? The user has a 20/100 chance of living.
」<br>
"Prehistoric path, another dangerous path to take. What's the other one?"
Crocus is not sure what path to enter. He was looking for the easiest random game
place by the name. If it's familiar or the danger is at least not that high.
'Let me look at the fourth path.'<br>
</section>
<section id="chapter4">
<h2>4 Game On!!</h2>
「 Unknown spirit path. Danger: 1/100% chance of surviving. 」
"Eh!? ...<br> Are you...<br> Wait...<br> This is incredibly dangerous, with only one percent of
success."<br><br>
Crocus was in disbelief after seeing the path.<br>
'The game dimension system said that I could die here, but isn't it a little outrageous!?
The other three only have a twenty percent chance of surviving and now this!?...<br> I
absolutely won't enter this path...<br> I don't want to court death.'<br>
Crocus snickered and looked at the three paths.<br>
"Hey system, what do you think is the best way to enter? The rewards are the same
because the dangers are the same, right?"<br>
He said a bit, and he was greeted with silence.<br>
"So, I remember I am already in the game and when I'm inside, the game dimension
system says I won't be able to communicate with him once I'm in. He could only
notify, like these, I am seeing now in every path."<br><br>
Crocus stood on the Prehistoric spirit path.<br>
"Since I am a fan of crocodiles, I have general knowledge of their ancestors. I'm
confident of taking one."<br><br>
「 Entered the Prehistoric game dimension, where the user can find its Prehistoric
spirit paths. Please answer the questions first: What kind of dinosaur do the users
like? What kind of environment and what kind of power does the user expect?<br>
」<br>

Bewildered at the notification, Crocus couldn't help but think about a lot of things.
'I wonder what this game dimension is doing. It's confusing me now, but well it seems
I need to answer.'<br>
"Of course I want crocodiles or in dino's name, Deinosuchus means Terrible
Crocodile. I want water areas and water powers like a hydrogen bomb."<br>
「 Analyzing, Analyzing...<br> The swamp accepted the user...<br> Now making a storyline...<br> 」
"Eh!? Storyline!? This game dimension system of mine is surprising me from left to
right. I hope the danger is not that dangerous...<br>
*Cough* *Cough*<br>
I was a little overwhelmed, but at least it's not making me anxious about it."<br>
Crocus said without a little panic.<br>
「 Beep! 」<br>
「 Beep! 」<br>
「 You are a little salt crocodile who needs to survive in this deep blue swamp. You
need to survive until you reach a level where you can eat anything to get the spirit.
「 Game: Reptile frenzy! 」<br>
All of the sudden, Crocus felt his muscles twisting. His vision turned blurry, then dark,
and at the end it was blue. He could feel his skin feeling wet and he wanted to catch
air, but not that much.<br>
"I'm underwater!? Wait, my body feels like it ain't a human anymore! What's going on!?
The way I swim feels like I'm a swimming reptile!"<br>
「 The user takes on the role of different reptilian species each trying to move up the
food chain. This time, you are a small crocodile. As smaller prey are eaten, the player's
own crocodile body grows in size and can eat a somewhat larger creature. By the end
of each level, the crocodile should be sufficiently large enough that it can eat almost
anything.<br>
」<br>
Reading this, Crocus suddenly tried to swim using his instincts.<br>
'Oh...<br> Hooooo! I can swim...<br> Sheer Ssshhh it feels good!<br>
'Sh*t I'm a crocodile! I'm a crocodile!'<br>
「 The game will start at...<br> 」<br>

「 3<br>
「 2<br>
「 1 」<br>
,
"Eh?!"<br>
Crocus went silent, as he could feel the ripples and the trembling water. As a
crocodile, his vision is so clear like in a human's eyes.
"Oh, no...<br> Those are fishes!? Why do they look like demons!?"
Crocus looked at his right side. He could see angry-looking fish with bone-like steel
on its forehead. Then Crocus turned his attention to the left. There, in that direction,
he could see a long-headed dinosaur with fins like feet flapping to swim and others
similar to it.
Crocus then turned his attention to his back. There are also fishes with long spines
and sharp spiky mouths.
"They look dangerous...<br>"<br>
He said with a little heavy feeling.
"Oh no!"<br>
His instincts kicked in panic.
"It's coming in my direction."<br>
Crocus tried swimming on the right side to avoid the incoming fishes. However, he
can sense in his vision that the ugly-looking fishes are following him.
"Their target is me!?"<br>
Crocus didn't know what to do. It was bigger than him and it was faster. It swiftly
reached him.
'I'm going to die!'<br>
Crocus closed his eyes to his end. However, for about a second, he couldn't feel
anything. When he opened his eyes, he saw the ugly-looking fish frozen in its place,
but what made him horrified was the mouth of something.
「 Warning: Spinosaurus ignores how much bigger you get. It will eat anything that
moves in a straight line, don't move in a straight pattern to avoid being eaten. 」
<br>
"Huh!? What was that!? I'm saved!?"<br>
Crocus had a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he's not dead yet. He swam freely to start the
game, when he saw smaller fish than himself, he thought little but to eat them and
complete the game.<br>
'I need to at least be careful, or else I won't get the spirit.
'Sigh...<br>
'So much for having a spirit, but I failed in my memory of this world in a supreme
leader's test. This is the only way I know where I could have a spirit again.'
Crocus saw a little fish swimming in the deep blue swamp, and without caring about
its look he opened his small crocodile mouth and chomped it!
*Crunch!* *Crunch!* *Crunch!*
"I thought the uglier it looked, the tastier it got<br>
Crocus did not stop there whenever he saw a smaller fish and was confident about
swallowing it whole. He would do it until he reached a level 15.
"What is the bubble over there?"
Crocus comes near the bubble.
"What can this do? Should I touch it?"
As a curious individual, believing in-game luck. He comes near the bubble and pops it
with his long crocodile mouth.
「 You have taken the multiplier bubble! To speed the level up Grab multiplier bubbles
whenever you can, especially in bonus levels. Second, Eat schools of fish, they are
worth a substantial amount extra. Third, Bite the Baryonyx's tails, it's usually a breeze
and worth an extremely large amount of points.
」
"Yes! I've triggered some well-hidden rewards!"
Crocus was delighted and trusted his instincts more than he happily devoured and
followed the suggestions of the hidden rewards.
As he levels up so fast...<br>
"I can feel it! The waves and power of this beast's spirit! I can feel it! Can it be that
having a spirit will give me powers? The 'All system' and my 'Game dimensions system'
both suggest power!?
.20,
,
"The Zombie apocalypse, the survival game that the 'All system' will put us in. With
this game dimension of mine, I wanna know more...<br> I want to know!"
Invigorating, reviving cells, hope that is sparking his heart and spirit. Crocus is
delighted. The way he swims is like he is flying in the sky with the freedom that he
dreamed of and always wanted.
"The spirit is circling and I can see its form! Am I going to have it? I'm I finally going to
have it?"
Crocus couldn't believe it, the feeling of finally having one can't describe through
words. He once thought that having a spirit is not that important to him as he lives his
second lifetime here, in this alternate universe, but now...<br>
"I can now understand the gleeful expression of my brothers and cousins when they
had spirits...<br> It's so good..<br>
Crocus suddenly had a melancholy.
"The Ashtaroth Baal Crocus in the earth, Prince Crocus Phereon in this alternate
world, both are me...<br> I did not steal a body, but I was reborn...<br> Now...<br> Remembering the
two lifetimes, I feel like it's still a dream...<br>"<br><br>
「 The player has reached level 80 cap. About to own the spirit...<br> 」
"What is my dream? Why am I so scared of being an undead zombie? Is this the life I
have had now? All this is just an illusion...<br> I'm still confused that I believe I'm not...<br>"<br><br>
...<br>
...<br>
"Huh?"
Crocus in his vision saw a fascinating creature.
"What a beautiful bluefish. It was swimming peacefully like an angel in the sky, giving
a blessing to those who were looking for tomorrow, hope, and a new day. Are you
coming to me...<br> Giving me hope? Are you a sign?"
「 Warning: the user got near the poisoned dragonfish! The user was dying! 」
Crocus was snapped back to his reality from melancholy because of that notification.
"Poisoned!? That fish is not a hidden reward!?"
「 Prince: Crocus Phereon
.21,
,
「 Level: 0<br> 
「 Health Points: 40/100<br> 
「 Status: Tired, Badly poisoned.<br> 
「 Hearts: 3<br> 
「 Spirit: None<br> 
「 Magic Power: None<br> 
「 Territory: Dust Territory<br> 
「 「 > 」<br> 
"What's going on!? Badly poisoned!? What the!? 40/100!?"
Crocus felt he was on the edge, but he can feel his body is getting harder to move.
"Poison is spreading all over my body!"
However, despite the resistance, he kept trying. Crocus can't cure the poison.
「 Poisoned to death, you failed. Game over. 」

<h2>5 Gunslinger!</h2>
「 Welcome back, your Majesty. 」
"I died, just like that!?"
Crocus said as he took a deep breath.
「 Yes, you did. 」<br>
.22,
,
Crocus ignored the game dimension system.
''I was so close, I need to get closer to have the spirit.''
「 You only have two or three lives left. 」<br>
Hearing this, Crocus couldn't help but doubt.
"I thought it's only two?"
「 Once your heart turns into a zero, then you'll die if you fail. 」<br>
"I see, so the third heart is used by me now. By the way, what is with spirits? Why
does my body crave it?"
「 Yes, spirits can be used to fight and lots of stuff. Your body craves it naturally
」<br>
because it wants to evolve and get stronger until it reaches the peak that it believes.
"But in this world, I only knew about the spirit that is designed for the royal and rich
family. As a status and not for fighting."<br><br>
「 Maybe it will change now. The magical mana already reached this earthoran so
having a spirit will stimulate that magical mana that can be used for a lot of things.
」
Hearing this, Crocus couldn't help but be curious.
"How do you know all this? Could it be that you have all the 'ALL SYSTEM' memories
of you? Everything about where it came from? All of it."<br><br>
「 Answering your highness, I know nothing about the 'ALL SYSTEM' or where it came
from. Everything was blocked in my memories of the 'ALL SYSTEM I copied. Maybe
because a being foresaw this or be prepared for everything that can happen.
」<br><br>
The hair on Crocus's back stood up. He didn't want to know that now, so he shook his
head and opened his mouth.
"Does it mean I need to have a Spirit to use the mana?"
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br><br>
Convinced that he needed to have one, he finally closed his eyes.
"Game On!"
Crocus was back to the paths. He hurriedly stood on the Prehistoric path.
However...<br>
「 User cannot enter Restricted. 」<br><br>


"What!?"
Crocus stared at the path with a blank stare.
"What's going on!? I can only play there once!?"
Crocus tried to leave and come back again a lot of times to make sure, however...<br>
「 Restricted: User not allowed to enter 」<br>
「 Restricted: User not allowed to enter 」<br>
「 Restricted: User not allowed to enter 」<br>
With his fingers on his chin.
"So, I could only enter one at a time. Am I not taking it easy? I never thought that it
would be that hard."<br><br>
Crocus looked at the other two while leaving the one that wasn't available.
"I guess I'll be choosing these two and first I don't like the creepy-looking one."<br><br>
Without thinking much of it, Crocus chose the path he likes other than the
Prehistoric one.
「 Enter this path? ...<br> Yes ( ✓ ) or No ( ✓ ) 」<br>
Crocus lifted his hand and was about to click when he noticed something.
'My hands are sweaty?'
Crocus shook his head.
'Doesn't matter, I know I could die in this game so it's alright. Things like this should
be normal. The only problem is how to have more hearts or Spirit power...<br> And first, a
Spirit.'
Soon, he clicked 'Yes'
「 You entered the modern weapon path! 」<br>
'Now, what kind of gaming dimension is it this time?' Crocus's skin went hazy and
warm, and his mind was looking unsettled.
「 Game: Survival troops. Please choose your weapon ...<br> Sword, gun, boxing gloves,
swimming trunks, Bazooka, saber, and rope. 」<br>

'Eh!? Not started? Okay...<br> Uhm...<br> I'll choose guns. I wonder why these game
dimensions of mine have games like this. I could understand the prehistoric must
have been in the past that there were dinosaurs, but these other weapon games? I am
not sure.'
Stopping Crocus from his thoughts...<br>
「 The user chose guns, get ready for...<br>
「 3
「 2
「 1 」<br>
Ding!
Crocus's eyes swirled and then he saw an old town like in western cowboy movies. His
eyes focus on his body, which is a little similar to a ghost.
*Turoro* *Waa-waa-waA*
*Turoro* *Waa-waa-waA*
*Turoro* *Waa-wa-wa-waA*
A piece of music rang in his heart, and then a notification appeared.
「 Gunslinging fight! In the wild wild west in 1883. An execution tournament was
being held in the gunslinger town, where the captive aboriginals were executed by
shooting. However, as a game, the Cowboys want to give Aboriginals a chance to
shoot the executioners back too. If the Aboriginals killed three or more cowboys, they
would be freed back to their homes.
「 You are one of the aboriginals who killed a cowboy in the past. With a little
knowledge about gunslinging, you can go against them using guns. Are you ready?
」<br>
Crocus's eyes shined and nodded. He noticed he materialized in the scene in this old
random town like those cowboy movies in the west. Adding the information about
using a gun.
「 You learned: Gunslinging - basic: 20 percent chance to hit a moving target. 」<br>
Hearing this, Crocus laughed a little. Inside his head, the gunslinging basic was
"What a surprise. Can I use it in the real world too?"
He mumbled, but no one was listening to him.
.
'Maybe I'll ask about my game dimension system later.'
Suddenly, Crocus noticed something was coming in the distance with the sound of
cowboy battle music.
*Turoro* *Waa-waa-waA*
*Turoro* *Waa-waa-waA*
*Turoro* *Waa-wa-wa-waA*
As the dust settles, he can hear a horse clopping its feet towards him slowly with a
man in a cowboy hat and clothing riding it.
「 First level
「 Opponent: Clint Roffer, The backdrop! 」<br>
"What's your gun, boy?"
Said the man, trying to climb down from his horse.
'The NPC can talk?'
However, he only watches the man named Clint finish and turn his face towards him.
"Not a loud talking friend arent's ya.. you wild grass. Well, since you don't want to, I
will just put you in your tomb to the ground and make a tombstone with the bullet
that I'm gonna kill ya. And say...<br> No name fella.
"Are ya ready for your Quick death? My baby is ready. I already got your no name in
my bullet."<br><br>
「 The opponent is asking if you need a count? 」<br>
Crocus was still stupefied by the game NPC, that speaks like a living being. That's why
he is still not replying.
'Well, I never thought the features would be this excellent, but it doesn't matter. I
know this is not a joke game and I need to focus on killing him.'
"Count!"
「 Player chose the count! Make sure that your health point won't be the one to go
down first. Hit as many as you can! Focus on the weak parts until the remaining time
stops.
「 Round one...<br>

「 3
「 2
「
「 Bang! 」<br>
,
Loud gunfire exploded as a signal to start the gunslinger's duel.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
「 Time: 5 seconds! 」<br>
An exchange of explosive blows made Crocus become excited and feel the danger of
this duel.
'I never thought this is fuckin' real! And I can feel the intensity of life and death duel!
So much fun! So much danger! And so much excitement!'
His eyes became red with a sharp murderous aura inside them.
「 Crocus Phereon Health Points: 74 percent. 」<br>
「 Clint Roffer Health Points: 62 percent. 」<br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Crocus Phereon and Clint Roffer keep firing at the same time. Their guns are the
same, Winchester model 1894 rifle on their right and Colt Python .357 magnum
Revolve on their right.
「 Time: 0 seconds 」<br>
Crocus, however, did not see it, but just kept on firing. Soon, he noticed his bullets
were not reaching Clint.
'Huh? Oh...<br> There's a time limit, no wonder.'
He thought as he looked at his opponent while trembling with excitement. Crocus
didn't know if it was because of fear or excitement or both but he is sure that he
doesn't care if it was NPC or real. Crocus will kill me all to get the spirits he wanted!
「 Crocus Phereon Health Points: 43 percent. 」<br>
「 Clint Roffer Health Points: 35 percent. 」<br>
.27,
,
Crocus felt good as his health was leading. He looked at his opponent who was so
carefree that he didn't even see the health points.
'This is fine. I just need to continue what I'm doing and shoot without hesitation so I
can finally enter the next round and get the Spirit.'
The NPC Clint did not care as it opened its mouth to Crocus.
"I told you, I got a bullet with your no name on it."<br><br>
「 Round two...<br>
「 3<br>
「 2<br>
「 1<br>
「 Bang! 」<br>
The two individual exchanges shot once again, and Crocus was happy because he was
going to have his first win but a notification appeared.
「 Backdrop ability: Once the health lowers to 30 percent, the bullet damage would be
two times fatal. 」<br>
</section>
<section id="chapter6">
<h2>6 2nd and 3rd chance</h2>
Crocus can feel the pain of death as his left eye and half of his head exploded. The
bullet of the enemy became fierce when it exploded as the notification of his skill
appeared.
.28,
,
'Isn't this ridiculous!? It's impossible to win!'
However, his complaint only met nothing but silence as his eyes shut into the
darkness...<br> Before Crocus loses consciousness, he hears the NPC talking to him.
"Son, accept the fate of losers. This cow boy's gonna drink some booze and get some
girls. I tell ya, no girls can resist a gunslinger like me."<br><br>
...<br>
The vision once again turned into a foggy atmosphere.
"All system, did I die again?"
Crocus asked with no energy.
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br>
The system answered like it usually does.
"I failed again."<br><br>
He said. His mind was so down and he was in a state of general unhappiness or
despondency.
Seeing the owner being like this.
「 You have got a gunslinger skill, your highness. Don't feel so down. 」<br>
Hearing this, Crocus made a little smile.
"Thank you for cheering me up. But well, the gunslinging ability is not useful against
the viruses in the atmosphere and soon I might become a creature that only eats
flesh."<br><br>
Beep! Beep!
「 To correct, your highness. You might become a creature that is full of rage and eat
flesh, a creature that is full of sadistic way to torture and kill, a mindless zombie that
only eats flesh but not rage, and the last is an anomaly.
」<br>
Crocus gasped with a little uncertainty.
"There are varieties? Is that one of your memories?"
「 Yes, your highness. There are varieties of flesh-eating creatures you might become,
and I can only tell you that. 」<br>
"You mean, you can't tell me everything about the 'All system'?"
.29,
「 Yes. 」<br>
,
"Why?"
「 The almighty that owns all systems will notice my existence if I dig deep into the
memories. You need to get stronger to know more about me and all systems Because
that might exist could take me over as you are weaker to him, currently.
」<br>
When Crocus heard it from the game dimension system, he was so surprised.
'Does it mean that as long as I can improve my spirit level, I will be ahead of everyone?
So I reed a spirit now? However, I didn't have a spirit yet, and those zombies — what
are they?'
He thought with worry so he asked...<br>
"Can you explain to me that variety of zombies, then?"
「 Unfortunately, your highness, I can't. You need to have spirit first to know the
details before you can do anything you want. 」<br>
"I see. Then, to become a king, I need to get out of this place and come back to the
palace. However, for me to leave, I need a Spirit to use the mana and I badly needed
it!"
「 You're right, your highness. 」<br>
Crocus closed his eyes for the meantime, and when he opened them, he muttered.
"Game On!"
The scene around Crocus changed once again. He is going to take the path that he
was so scared of earlier with determination to live this life. His mind was driven by
words that were whispering into his entire being!
I will be a king! I will be a king! I will be a king!
「 User entered the Elemental Ghost Spirit path! 」<br>
His surroundings became twisted and dark like he was in a dead forest. To keep his
calm, he is mumbling his words that he will become what he desires!
"A king!"
'I will be a king! I will be a king! I will be a king! I will be a king!'
With this, he manipulated himself to keep himself from fearing whatever it was in this
game. As a gamer on earth, he is not r fan of horror and even horror in games.
.30,
,
「 Game: Dead Forest Run! 」<br>
'Dead forest run? Is this going to be like a game temple run?'
Crocus thought, but he was standing on a giant tree branch that was going in a very
long direction.
「 You have stolen a treasure inside the dead forest that is the home of a sadistic
witch. Her treasure was protected by a guardian that is now chasing you until the end
of the giant root!
「 Aim: Avoid the woods that will slow the player/user and get at least two hundred
ropes before the witch dangerous werewolf reaches you! 」<br>
"So, it's not that scary. What are the ropes for?"
As the game was about to start. He ignored and did not hope for something to tell him
what they were for. He was in a game, he would do what was in a game.
*Awwooooohhhh!!*
The howl in the darkest night made Crocus even more fearful of the game. He knew
that this was just the game, but he also knew that the pain was real. He didn't want to
experience being ripped apart by that werewolf creature.
Unconsciously, Crocus's whole body ran forward without him controlling it. He can't
also feel tired from the run as he moves and whistles through the wind.
"Ah! So I won't be tired of this thing."<br><br>
Crocus said as he sped not so fast enough. All of the sudden, the hair on his back
stood up. He can feel a wild, rumbling stomach. When he looked back, he saw a giant
mouth of a beast excitedly wanting to bite him.
"G*d damn! Can't I become even faster? Just one wrong move. I'll surely be torn to
pieces!"
The creature looks like a wolf and a bull at the same time. The mouth, whenever it
opens and tries to chomp Crocus would release ghastly wails and cries of unknown
dark creatures.
A threat stimulus, such as the sight of a predator, triggers a fear response in the
amygdala of Crocus. His consciousness asks for fear or flight.
ObIt'slight.
.31,
,
It activated when he saw the creature and all the things he saw in this world. For him,
nothing can compare to this wolf creature.
"There's a rope!"
Crocus noticed the things he needed. Speedy and greedily met it with his hands.
However, it passed through him and disappeared.
「 You got 7 ropes 「 7 / 100. 」<br>」<br>
Soon, whenever he sees a rope, he won't miss it while thinking.
'I will be a King! I will be a King! I will be a King!!'
However, while he is busy with self-manipulation forget the terror of the beast at his
back.
Pak!
He was slowed by a block of wood.
The terrorizing wolf did not waste time. It chomp Crocus' head and it exploded like an
egg crushed by a rock!!

<h2>7 Old man Asmo Jos</h2>
"Aarrgghh!! The pain!"
The sound and pain of his broken bones were still fresh to Crocus.
'I feel like I am losing my mind over the pain. I can feel that it's still piercing my head! I
can't take it.'
「 Welcome back, your highness. 」<br>
.32,
,
After hearing about his gaming dimension system, he realized something.
'So I died again.'
Getting up from the pain.
"System, What is my current status?"
「 Answering the owner -
「 Former Prince: Crocus Phereon
「 Level: 0
「 Health Points: 100/100
「 Status: Tired
「 Hearts: 1
「 Spirit: None
「 Magic Power: None
「 Territory: Dust Territory
「「 > 」<br>
"Ha! I hate the former sh*t and my heart has only one heart left. This is frustrating."<br><br>
Crocus felt disheartened.
"Tell me, is it okay for me to go out for the time being, right?"
「 You can always do everything as you please, your highness. 」<br>
"Before I go, how did my code create you? Isn't it a little impossible?"
「 You're right, your highness. When I first entered the 'All system' consciousness, the
terrible coding and the spatial cracks were fixed by the stored magic of the 'All
system. They sent a separate 'All system' with limited mana, which is me. We need to
be connected to a soul to be controlled and survive. However, the almighty one who
created us didn't have a single soul in this separate, unknown dimension. So, leaving
with no option, we chose yours.
」<br>
"That's good. What a relief. What about the games I experienced earlier, the
gunslinging game, prehistoric game, witch game, and the one that I didn't experience
gaming, yet? Are they from the past? My system code only created instances from it?"
.33,
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br>
,
"Ha...<br> At least, I ain't a system of slave...<br> My system is my slave. Haha!"
「 You're right, your highness. I am your slave. 」<br>
"So, how do I get out of this place for the time being?"
「 You highness, just say 'Game Off!' 」<br>
"Really?"
「 Yes, your highness, I would never lie to you. 」<br>
"That's great. I won't ask you any more questions to avoid the unknown almighty, but
do you think I could defeat him?"
「 I cannot answer that, your highness. 」<br>
"How many years you think I could become a King."<br><br>
「 Depends on what is happening right no, with this survival apocalypse game, but
estimating your current condition, it would take at least 24 years for the people to
accept you.
」<br>
"Sh*t that's too long."<br><br>
「 You are right, your highness. Do you plan to give up? 」<br>
"No!"
「 That's fine. 」<br>
"That's fine, Game off!"
Outside the dark part of a park, a stone statue with seven grotesque faces carved in it.
Below it, a man who was sleeping soundly suddenly opened his eyes.
"So I'm still at the park,"
Crocus tilts his and looks left to right. He saw the statue but ignored it because he
still felt groggy from his dimension.
"Sigh, my eyes...<br> I can still see everything was coated with red. The virus is still
affecting me. I need to get spirits, but it's too hard to get one."<br><br>
Getting up, Crocus walked to find the exit of the park. All of a sudden, he saw an old
man feeding a parrot.
.34,
,
"People in the park?...<br> At a time like this?...<br> Why though?"
The old man who was having a good time noticed him, too. He had a look of surprise,
but soon he waved his hand at Crocus.
"Me?"
Crocus made a gesture as if he was asking if it was him.
The old man nodded.
Crocus looked at his back and saw no one was there. He knew it was him.
Coming closer, the old man greeted him with a smile.
"Did you also try to get the spirit of seven demons? I tried a lot of times, yet I failed.
Now I'm here to honor them before I die, as thanks for making my generation and my
brother's life easy and peaceful."<br><br>
Crocus noticed the envious tone of the old man, but he said nothing about it.
"Old man, what are the seven demon spirits?"
The old man gave him a surprised look.
"You didn't see the statue there?"
Crocus touches his chin as he contemplates.
"I saw, but I don't know what they are."<br><br>
The old man's look was dumbfounded. A second later, with the ignorant look Crocus
was showing, the old man calmed down.
"The seven demon spirits are said to be the most dangerous but most helpful spirits in
the world for their influence on the world. If someone had their blessing, they would
give them their sinful talents, First carved face can make yourself always feel at peace,
in Second carved face is a never-ending determination, the third is a charm, the
fourth is an adaptation to everything, the fifth is for money, Sixth is finding new ideas
and last is Seventh, the power of health."<br><br>
With this information, Crocus couldn't help but think of something.
"Where do they come from, though? Are you here to tame one of them as spirits?"
'Hm?'
.35,
,
The old man can feel Crocus's curiosity. Without the slightest bit of hesitation, he
answered...<br>
"Yes."<br><br>
The old man's tone changed and became serious and full of hatred and envy. His
silence was noticed by Crocus as the old man tried to calm himself. He tried to dig his
old finger points skins that made Crocus feel that the old man's hatred was so deep.
"By the way, what's your name, old man? And why are you without your family?"
He just casually asked the old while thinking of going back for the seven demons'
spirits to get them as his spirits. However, soon Crocus shook his head, thinking that
it must be a dangerous path with only a one percent survival rate.
"My name is Asmo jos. I don't have a family...<br> never had one and never married."<br><br>
Crocus was obviously not listening as he tried to think where he could get spirits in
his memories. The old man continued...<br>
"I have met a kind and beautiful girl. She was perfect. She is 22 years old while I'm 24
years old. Before we got married, she asked me if her friend could also attend the
wedding. The friend was male, also married, and I trusted her and her friend, so I
happily accepted.
"However, on the night of the wedding. My wife-to-be was in her wedding dress,
looking beautiful, while her friend was looking at her deeply with a smile. My wife-to-
be also smiled back at him as they both tried to look left and right. I know they are
trying to find me, so I hid before they noticed me.
"I closed my eyes. I told myself that nothing will happen. She won't do it to me on our
wedding day and I trusted her...<br> But after a minute I tried to find them both, but I
couldn't. I searched for the rooms and the only one left was the Comfort room.
"It's locked, so I waited. After a few minutes, the guy's friend came out first, and the
girl followed while I was there waiting. My wife-to-be tried to convince me she just
asked her friend to fix her dress, but I don't believe her. She could've asked other
female members of our family, and then I asked for an annulment.
"After that, I never married till I grew old."<br><br>

<h2>8 Acquaintances</h2>
Hearing this, Crocus was stupefied and didn't know what to say.
"Did you hate them?"
The old only gave an empty smile.
"My hatred can't do anything. However, the feeling that I'm feeling whenever I am
reminded of that is something I can't explain. I always ask, why me? Why can they do
it to me? Why can't I become like them? Why am I not able to do that to them? Why?
Why?
"That's why right here, right now I want to get one of the seven demon spirits! To
change! To change everything about me! To change everyone, everything I want to
change!!!"
After releasing his emotional outburst, the old man's bird flew away. He stood up and
went in the statue's direction where there was a carving of the seven demon spirits.
Crocus, however, was staring at the ground silently.
'I don't know how to react to that, I feel...<br> I...<br> If I were in that situation, what would I
do? What should I do? I can only imagine myself skewing them both in a stick alive
because I know my pride won't accept that. Or enslave their Family and never feed
them until they die of hunger...<br>'
Crocus could only sigh.
'I can't do anything about it, nor do I want to do something about it. It's not like it's
my life, but it's good to at least know why the old man is envious. I need to get going.'
Crocus walked slowly. The life of the old man affected him but he knew that if there
was a time he would experience that, he wouldn't want to be weak as the old man.
He stopped walking for a moment. He froze forcefully and closed his eyes.
.37,
,
'Crocus, remember you'll be a king. those kinds of experiences would be normal in
your eyes. You will get a lot of girls and a harem that would be your plaything.'
All his worry, all his problems of becoming a zombie disappeared in an instant. He
opened his eyes and thought.
"Now I feel good. I wonder what is happening outside of this park and in this City.
Must have been chaotic like in my imagination. I shouldn't have left far away, and I
wouldn't have a problem as I do right now."<br><br>
Crocus made a fist.
Wap!
His skull made a little crack as he punch it with all his might.
"Remember Crocus how are you going to be a King or a supreme leader if you keep
blaming yourself? You keep blaming everything on destiny, you keep blaming your
fate, you already have a gaming dimension, you only need to get a spirit and
everything you desire will be in your palm!"
'I just need to find a safer place or a place where I could get a new spirit.'
Crocus finally calmed himself down. Was about to move when...<br>
Ring! Ring!
Ring! Ring!
"My phone?"
Ring! Ring!
Ring! Ring!
"I still have this and the thugs that beat me up didn't take it? Why?"
Taking it out of his pocket.
'Doesn't matter, and what is this? Who is this? Unregistered number?'
Clock!
"Who is this?"
Crocus said with curiosity.
"This is me, Fanna. Do you still remember me?"
.38,
,
Crocus stopped.
'How did she know about that thing? Is she one of them? Those grunts and thugs are
paid to make me forget? Wait, if she's not one of them, she shouldn't expose herself
easily.'
Fanna is a childhood friend, daughter of his uncle, and his fiance.
"I don't. Who is this?"
A painful cry suddenly resounded in Crocus's ears. He can feel the pain and he felt the
girl is truly sincere about her pain.
"I'm sowwy...<br> I shoou.. shoouull… have known.. you- your uncle is shady...<br> The- they
are planning to me-make your talented brother take over...<br> Be-become the su-
supreme leader...<br>
"Uwaahh!!
"Sowwyy...<br> Croci...<br> Sowwyy...<br>"<br><br>
Hearing this, Crocus realized he was thinking too much.
"I'm just kidding. What are they planning?"
He said with a smile on his face.
"Aunt Lissy and uncle's supreme leader want to eliminate you. They said they wasted
all their time and energy nurturing you, and they have been planning it for a long
time. That's why they are focusing on your younger brother Phereon Fuma."<br><br>
Fanna said while sobbing and crying.
"Okay, don't cry. But how did you know?"
Crocus was wondering how she knew it, so he asked.
"Fu- fu- fuma told me he will become the supreme leader and you will die outside the
city. They already commanded someone to take you outside the city where the people
were left to die in the incoming apocalypse.
"You gotta come home fast! I don't want to marry that guy, please. Protect me, and I
only want to marry and serve you."<br><br>
Fanna as she cries once more.
Crocus furrowed his brow, and his eyes burned with anger.
.39,
,
"Don't bullshit me. We are not that close and I know you are not Fanna. I also know
her number, so who are you!? what do you want!?"
Crocus may have a childhood friend, and a fiance, but she never cries like that. He is
not even in love with the real Fanna. Adding the fact that somehow, his other self from
the earth also combined with his memories in this earthoran. He is not sure what he
is right now or who he was...<br>
Crocus Phereon
Or
Ashtaroth Baal Crocus.
Both are him and he knows that one thing is for sure, both personalities want to
become powerful and influential individuals.
"What do you want and who are you!?"
The phone became silent. Soon it chuckled, and the voice changed.
"Oh...<br> The oldest brother, it's me...<br> Jessica...<br> I'm just testing my new ability with MY
NEW S.P.I.R.IT. I'm telling you, my elder brother Fuma will become the next supreme
leader. Once you die, he will officially become one.
"He awakened our ancestral Family bloodline spirit, the blue dragon. Everyone and
our parents accepted he should become one. So they need to get you out of the
picture by throwing you outside by removing your memories.
"They say that you are not fit to become one, not fit to become a supreme leader, and
your talent is only average. The biggest factor is that you can't awaken our ancestral
spirit consciousness."<br><br>
Crocus did not finish; he wants to know more about their true colors.
"They said that? Why not kill me instead? Jessica, what did I ever do to all of you and
especially you? I treated you well."<br><br>
Jessica, on the other side of the phone became silent for a moment.
"Hahaha!"
Her tone changed into something full of mocking.
"Elder brother...<br> Elder Brother...<br> Elder brother...<br> You have no idea what kind of loser
you are. You may be kind to me, but I know that you just do something. That is my
.40,
,
affection and love for a family. You are manipulating me into your little girl. There's
only one brother I would look up to and that's...<br>
"My
"Only
"Brother Fuma."<br><br>
A little pissed at his little sister.
"You know I'm not like that."<br><br>
Jessica only laughed harder at his reply.
"You're lucky. Our other sisters beg your father not to kill or else...<br> But well, you will
die soon after the apocalypse starts. Even if you come back, you will have no family to
get back to and no special position. Goodbye!!"

<h2>9 Mysterious Lady</h2>
Crocus did not answer the phone in his hand. However, he is still not sure so he would
call his mother and father. After a minute of deciding he wanted to confirm it for
himself, he hung up on Jessica and called.
Ring! Ring! Ring!
Ring! Ring! Ring!
Crocus gripped his hands out of disappointment.
"My mother didn't want to answer. Was she held captive? Did she want to throw me
away? She approved it!? No. She must have been busy right now, and I should not be
that negative."<br><br>
.41,
,
After fifteen calls, Crocus gave up.
"Sigh. I need to confirm it with my father."<br><br>
Ring! Ring! Ring!
Ring! Ring! Ring!
"What's wrong? Son? You're alive?"
Heard the voice of his father, Luther Phereon the supreme leader. Crocus couldn't
help but be happy about it.
"Father, please pick me up in this park. The park with seven demon heads that I'm not
familiar with. Do you know it?"
On the other side of the phone, a man with a fierce look on his face was holding his
phone, with a woman close to him. Looking at the woman, Luther could only change
his tone.
''So my son is alive? No, He should've forgotten about everything. I regret not
throwing him into a forest. He will just disturb the ceremony and will just create a
drama. I need Fuma to be a supreme leader and awaken the ancient spirit.
"It doesn't matter. His breathing is not fine, and he still didn't have a spirit yet. So he
will turn into a flesh-eating undead soon. At least I don't sound a bad father to his
death.''
These words were not heard by Crocus, so Crocus kept asking.
"Father, help me. I want to become a supreme leader. Please, father, please."<br><br>
The sound of Crocus on the other side was like that of a Kid. This is his first time
acting like this because he is planning something.
Veins bulge in his head. Luther is annoyed with the way his son is acting.
"You are not a child anymore, and I gave you everything in the past, and that's
enough! Now, you need to get out or you would destroy my country! This country and
I don't need a son who didn't even have the talent to awaken any of our royal spirits! I
am disowning you and I am disgusted with you."<br><br>
Crocus didn't reply. A drop-dead silence was between them.
"Father, is there any chance that I could become a King or a Supreme leader?"
He said in a calm tone.
.42,
,
Luther only shook his head as he laughed at his son.
"You!? Ha! Remember these Croci! You are not my son anymore, and I don't want to
hear anything about you. I also erased your mother into existence and soon I will
throw my children away to die in the apocalypse in the future. Never come back to
this place or I will bury you myself."<br><br>
In the park, Crocus had a dead expression on his face. He never thought that his
father would react that way. His father was not like that in the past, so he was deeply
disappointed.
"Remember father, I never once hated you. Even when you said those words, I never
had an ounce of anger. However, I recognized the severing of our relationship as a
father and son. Remember, If ever live and come back, I will make sure that you and
the others will pay.
"I will make sure that whoever is with you in this thing, I will enslave the women and
their future generations! I will feed their children to the dogs! Just you wait, I honor
my words! Bastard supreme leader!"
Crocus cursed at his father, to make himself feel and to remember his mother in this
world that was killed by his father.
Luther looked at the woman and then replied.
"You dare to say that to me!? Your supreme leader!? I wish I never raised a bastard son
like you! You are a disgrace to the Family and the Phereon bloodline! And you! Will
never become a King as long as I am sitting in this land!"
Crocus crushed the phone in his hands. He couldn't take it. His father murdered his
mother, and he is so mad about it. However, his pride is keeping him from going crazy.
'God damn it! God damn it! I am so weak and I didn't even have a spirit animal! F*ck!
How can I have my revenge and the title King if I didn't even have a single spirit on
me?
'I already have gaming dimensions, so what am I scared of? Am I lacking in
motivation? No! Why am I so agitated? I need to get away from this place!'
Without a warning while Crocus was contemplating.
Ding! Ding! Ding!
[ Humans of earthoran! I am back! Your favorite all system! ]
The entire world came to a stop. Even Crocus couldn't move, even though he tried to.
.43,
,
[ As all of you are wondering, yes! The entire world was on pause! Even the flying little
bacteria that your eyes couldn't see are not moving. Errhhmm!! As I was saying, all of
you are now in a game. A game that is so dangerous that you all wished that you
enjoyed the last days of your peace.
[ Commit suicide? I would love to accept your soul and play with them while I am
bored. Now, I am back to tell you all that you now improve your levels. By killing
different kinds of zombies. A variety I mean.
[ That is all, so those who aren't immune will be turned into one of those varieties of
the undead. You have an hour to have spirits before it all starts! Those who are
immune can now prepare!
[ 60 minutes...<br> 59 seconds...<br>
[ 60 minutes...<br> 58 seconds...<br>
[ 60 minutes...<br> 57 seconds...<br>
[ ...<br> ]
After letting all the others move again, Crocus cannot hear a sound outside this park.
If they are chaotic or not.
"I don't know where I am and I feel like I'm in a random small town with a little park."<br><br>
Crocus looked back at where the seven demons' carvings were.
"I have no other choice. I need to at least try it even if I die. I can't go around and find
another. Just sleeping or meditating alone would take me a lot of time because a lot of
things happened. With my pride, I'm sure that I don't want to become a flesh-eating
undead or whatever variety that is!
"It's done or die! No more running! No more joking!"
...<br>
"That bastard should've forgotten about me and his past!"
Said Luther, while looking out the window.
"Do you want me to take care of your son?"
Said the woman at the back of Luther. Luther however, snorted with a cold look.
"I will take care of him if he survives this first game of survival."<br><br>

<section id="chapter10">
<h2>10 Seven demon master</h2>
After thirty minutes of trying to calm down. Crocus finally made it!
「 Seven demon spirit paths. Danger: 1/100% chance of surviving. Enter? Yes ✓ or No
✓ 」<br><br>
"Yes!"
「 Welcome to the demonic wave! Kill as many as you! Kill as many demons as you
can! Until running out! You can choose your demon! Survival of the fittest!
「 Please choose your weapon: Shield <> Sword <> Gun <> Arrow <> 」<br>
"What to choose? Should I use guns? After all, that's the only thing I know!!"
「 User chose guns 」<br>
All of the sudden, Crocus felt something different from being human. He had a tail,
two horns, and pistol magnum guns left and right.
"Hell yeah! I am a hell boy, baby!"
Crocus said as he couldn't contain his feelings about his new look! Soon he was silent
and wait for the game to start.
「 Game: Demonic Suicide! Once you die, you will only get your reward! 」<br>
"God damn! Another unsurpassable game. Why not give me something easy?"
Crocus knew it was all useless because he heard a rumbling in the distance.
「 Survive the fiery demon emperor's ghastly auras! Use any means necessary! 」<br>
Hearing this, Crocus was stunned.
'What do you mean? Then what's the gun and weapons for?'
.45,
,
All the thoughts he could think of disappeared as the heatwave of hell envelops him. It
was like radiation despite his demonic body appearance. Its skin was tearing up and
the pain was so intense that at any second his body and soul would break away.
「 You are dying! 」<br>
Hearing this, while resisting the pain, Crocus was becoming mad. Combating his
death by manipulating himself so that he will become king!
'I don't want to die here!'
「 You are dying! 」<br>
'I won't become a zombie outside! In my earth life, never honor my words! In this life I
had in earthoran, I honor my words! Still, I am proud of myself and my pride! I always
ignore things and the achievements of everyone thinking that those are small
achievements! Yeah! Those are small achievements! Even on the day that I couldn't
awaken my spirit, I always think that those spirits are below me! My pride is so high!
And now! I will become King and Still, I won't lower my pride! Never!'
「 You are dying! 」<br>
'No matter! So what if this sh*t tries to kill me? My obsession will keep me alive and I
am proud of that! Because I honor my words! I want to be powerful and become a
king! I will be a King! I will show the world that I have become King even if it's short
live or long! I will die as a King! I cannot afford to die now! I will have spirits that are
out of this world and in the future, I will trample on everyone!'
「 You have passed the impossible test! Congrats!
「 Former Prince: Crocus Phereon
「 Level: 1
「 Health Points: 13/100
「 Mana: 100/100

.46,
,
「「 > 」<br>
Crocus stared at the bar and wondered what happened.
'What is this? Did I pass? Am I the main character with cliche plot armor? What's
going on?'
Soon he saw that the world he was in became twisted. Only darkness was there, and a
man covered in light appeared out of nowhere.
「 Hello, I am Urham! A witch. What you see right now is my remaining consciousness
to warn whoever knows the secret of the seven demon carvings. 」<br>
'Cut scenes?'
「 I tried to summon the seven demons in the past. However, I cannot control it
because the soul I have is limited. I end up dying because of that, and for the last
moment, I tried to seal them in a statue, hoping someday that someone could tame
and use their spirits.
「 I am so intrigued and shocked to know when I saw you. A human with two souls!
You should have died long ago, but I can feel that somehow, the two souls you have
are the same. That's the reason you didn't die. I don't know and never heard of a
human that can have two souls.
「 It's also the reason you withstood the seven demon possessions of you. Even in
death, I am proud that I have met you, the demon in a human...<br> Pride. 」<br>
Soon the cut scenes disappeared and those words, however, were not registered on
Crocus' head; he was busy looking at his stats.
「 」<br>
After clocking the ' > '.
「 Abilities:
「 Universal Silence: Shock all kinds of existence universally, making enemies receive
a shock to space and time. All magic, physical, copy and sound magic power pauses,
and a sin of pride fulfills his prophecy.
「 Prideful transformation - he will transform into a black angel with one wing and he
will be strengthened many times depending on his controlled sin demons for only a
short amount of time. Makes him immune to all kinds of physical and magical control
power and also enables him to touch all kinds of untouchable existence. However, it
needs large mana to be used.
.47,
,
「 Silent Throne: Makes all magic and physical magic users turn into a powerless
normal human in his presence about six meters as long as he is sitting on a throne.
Without a throne or going away / standing away from it would make this skill
deactivate. Can also summon his six demons from anywhere on this throne, but this
throne doesn't work on monsters that are not related to humans.
「 Eyes of Sin demons: the demon master can conjure demon eyes which grant those
who were possessed by it. The power depends on their greatest demonic feelings.
The main body of the seven demons is not affected by the powers of the demons he
controlled.
」<br>
"My abilities are too damn strong!
"Hahahahahahahaha!
"Hahahahahahahaha!
"Finally, I never thought that I got it! I am the only one! I am the chosen and my path
to becoming a King is open! No, right now they should kneel before me! And beg me I
should rule them! Hahaha!"
All of a sudden, Crocus made a fist without a second thought. He smashed it in his
face.
"Did I just say that? I need to calm down...<br> I can't be controlled by the demon of pride
or I would die anytime because of my arrogance."<br><br>
「 Congratulations, your highness for owning a spirit demon. Are careful of its
influence or you would become the demon itself. 」<br>
"What? You are here? And I'll become a demon?"
「 Yes, your highness. The game has ended, and if you become a demon, the name
Crocus Phereon would be gone. 」<br>
"So How do I avoid that?"
「 I am not entirely sure about your highness. However, I know you need to control
your pride or it will consume you. 」<br>
"That is a big problem, isn't it?"
.48,
,
11 Usage of power
「 That is not a problem, your highness. You have me. 」<br>
Hearing this, Crocus froze to his game dimension system. Scratching the back of his
head while remembering the game difficulties he faced in the past.
"You are right, those games are so hard and the only time I won was because of the
luck that I have two souls. However, I accept they humbled me."<br><br>
「 That is not your only problem, your highness. 」<br>
"What do you mean by that?"
「 You can choose whoever demonic powers you like, your highness. It is Pride,
Wrath, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Gluttony, or Greed. And every use of them will have you
subjected to becoming a demon if you have too much sin in every use. So be careful of
using any of these sinful powers.
」<br>
"I see no wonder I have seven hearts. So, what are the abilities of those demonic sins
that I can use?"
「 Sin demon: ' Wrath ' -
「 Ultimate Demonic Eye: While it grants Wrath an extra-sensory vision of his general
surroundings, the Eye's true ability is precognition, allowing Wrath to perfectly and
efficiently expect all variables and his opponent's attacks and take action with
absolute efficiency with no effort.
「 Wrath's body would transform into a demon. His demonic body would release dark
magic and whenever he damages an enemy, he will put them in a curse that digs
deeper wounds in the enemy, causing consecutive attacks to the same enemy to deal
more damage with the use of unlimited mana. He would die if the main body of the
seven demons dies.
」<br>
"Wait...<br><br> Wait...<br><br> What is this demonic Wrath transformation?"
Crocus said as he wondered and imagine what was that.
「 Answering your highness, it's just like Pride that will transform into a winged black
angel creature. 」<br>
.49,
,
"Cough...<br><br> Cough...<br><br> What the! Are you sure?"
「 Yes, your highness. 」<br>
"Okay...<br><br>. *Cough* What about the next one?"
「 Sin demon: ' Envy ' -
「 Idle Transfiguration and absorption - allows the user to reshape or absorb the soul
of themselves or anyone they physically touch. The shape of the body depends on the
shape of the soul, so if the soul is distorted or absorbed, so is the body. Therefore,
someone using Idle Transfiguration and absorption can disfigure and absorb their
target's body into something grotesque by warping their soul's shape with just a
touch.
「 Envy can only absorb anyone weaker than it if he transforms into his second form
fleshy demon. Can use unlimited mana but would die if the main body of seven
demons dies.
」<br>
"This one is a little scary...<br><br> But wait, what is this with unlimited use of mana?? I
thought I could only borrow their powers for a time being? Can it be used with
limitation or duration?"
「 Your highness, they can use unlimited mana outside as long as you don't die.
However, they can also die like 'Wrath'; he may see attacks and evade them easily, but
if he encounters creatures with blood bending or any controlling power, he would die.
」<br>
Crocus had a look of confusion on his face.
"Wait...<br><br> Wait...<br><br> Wait...<br><br> I'm a little confused. Can you tell me what and how my powers
can be used inside random game dimensions and outside of it?"
He asked.
「 The usage of your powers inside a random game dimension would be random too,
your highness. Since you have me serving you, it's my responsibility to tell you
whenever you meet a random spatial crack...<br><br> I mean game dimension. There are game
dimensions that want to use only one sin demon power. There are two, there are
three, and more...<br><br>
」<br>
"I see...<br> then what about outside? How do I use my powers?"
「 To your sin demon powers on the outside, where there is an old system like me.
There are two ways: First, release all the demon spirit eyes you conjured in the
.50,
,
outside world. It will spread and search for the greater host and you will get clones
you can control whenever you want.
「 Second is turning yourself into a seven demon permanently. Seven heads and
twenty-eight limbs are kinds of demons.
「 Once you choose your path, there is no turning back. 」<br>
The hair of Crocus's skin stood up when he heard the Game Dimension system's
second option.
"I choose the first one of course! There's no way you'd turn me into a demon with lots
of limbs and faces."<br>
「 You'll be much more powerful in the second option, your highness. Plus, you can all
have seven demon powers while using only minimum mana. 」<br>
Crocus rolled his eyes.
"I want to be a King of humans, not demons. Plus, I can't accept having an ugly demon
face. I bet even more demonic Pride spirits wouldn't like it."<br>
「 To demons, the more head and limbs you have, the more handsome you are. 」<br>
"No...<br> Can...<br> Do...<br> I need to test my powers and release the seven demons outside,
right?"
After all, to Crocus. It's more important to train before jumping into danger and war.
「 Your highness, when you said that you choose the first option, the seven demon
spirit eyes already departed from your body. Plus, you don't have the time to test your
power, your highness.
」<br>
"It's so fast, I didn't even feel it. What do you mean I can't test my powers?"
「 When you were here talking to me, the seven demon spirit eyes phased through
the time-space and already found hosts on their own. And I'm saying you don't have
the time to practice because the timer of the 'All system' is nearing the start of the
zombie apocalypse.
"How many times have I left?"
「 About 10 minutes and 23 seconds. 」<br>
"May I at least know what the zombie varieties are?"
.51,
,
「 Your highness, you need to improve the level of your cultivation before you know
what those things are. 」<br>
"Oh...<br> Shoot...<br> Why not here?"
「 This place's spatial cracks have been replaced by you already and it needs a month
before it opens again. Now you need to find another location to play again. 」<br>
Crocus didn't understand what this game dimension is always saying.
"What? The spatial cracks? In the game dimension."<br>
He asked with confusion all over his face.
"You, the user, are fixing spatial cracks that have a high amount of wasted mana. To fix
them, the game dimension would create a game sequence or instance for you to
complete. Once you beat the game, you have fixed the spatial cracks and have taken
the excess mana that is on those cracks."<br>
However, Crocus is not focused on it as he was thinking about how to survive the
incoming apocalypse.
"Really? By the way...<br> How can I gain the seven demon sins' power or abilities
permanently? And not for the time being?"
「 To have the power permanently, you need to choose a demon that will reach a
hundred to gain it permanently. However, you can only copy one of its abilities. 」<br>
"I see. So if I made my four sin demons improve to a hundred levels, then I can have
four of them."<br>
「 Yes. However, your level needs to be at least at the same level or higher than theirs
to use their powers, or even possess them or control them completely because they
can improve their level without them knowing. You are the only one capable of seeing
their level once they are tagged as an anomaly.
」<br>
Seeing it all, Crocus couldn't help but feel complicated.
"That's a hard sh*t. Is it possible to lower their level?"
「 Your highness, you only have 7 minutes to prepare for the apocalypse. 」<br>
"Please answer."<br>
「 It's not possible for your highness but you can improve your level by focusing the
experiences on one of them only. 」<br>
